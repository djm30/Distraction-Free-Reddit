## Features

Distraction Free Reddit allows you to customize your Reddit experience by hiding various parts of the site that can lead to mindless scrolling and distract you from your goals. Here are some of the features:

- Hide main feed: Hide the main feed of posts on the Reddit homepage, to help you avoid getting sucked into endless scrolling.
- Hide r/all and popular: Hide the r/all and popular feeds, which can be sources of distractions and time-wasting content.
- Hide user profiles: Hide the user profile pages, which can lead to comparing yourself to others and feeling like you're missing out.
- Hide full page search: Hide the search bar and full page search results, which can be a source of distractions.
- Hide sidebar: Hide the sidebar on subreddit pages, which can contain distracting or irrelevant information.
- Hide comments: Hide the comment sections on posts, which can be a source of time-wasting debates or irrelevant information.
- Whitelist mode: Enable a whitelist mode to only allow access to certain subreddits that you specify. This can help you focus on content that is relevant to your interests or goals.
- Blacklist mode: Enable a blacklist mode to block access to certain subreddits that you find distracting or unhelpful. This can help you avoid time-wasting content and stay focused on your goals.

These settings will hopefully allow you to use reddit in a more intentional way and encourage a healthier relationship with the site.
