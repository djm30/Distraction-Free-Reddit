# Random Ideas I have while developing

1. At the minute, I'm not sure whether the classes Reddit uses things like the main body tend to change upon new releases, so I should create some API service that the extension can call on a weekly basis that provides the latest classes to block certain features and then store them into the extensions file storage

2. The users username can be retrieved from a cookie, this is not for user tracking, but more so that the user can select the block user profile feed option but still be able to access their own

3. Have an option not to block the main feed, but only allow post from 
certain subreddits to appear on it instead, potentially as a completely 
separate list, kind of a redundant feature in technicality since you can 
just unsub, but this offers a potentially quicker and more reversible 
solution


Note -> Popup component should be called index, options should be called options
